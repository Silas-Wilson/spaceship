Just things I thought of that I want to make sure I don't forget.

URGENT:
- Make it impossible to place components that are not attached to any part of the ship

NOT URGENT:
- make player movement less bad (Max linear and rotational speed, quicker acceleration, etc)
- make a stats script on the player that calculates the mass, strength of linear and rotational
  acceleration, HP, stuff like that.
- hitting enemys at high speeds has GOTTA hurt bruh
- chance for an enemy to spawn that is the ship you built on the last playthrough
