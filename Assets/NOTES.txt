Just things I thought of that I want to make sure I don't forget.

- make the mass of the rigidbody increase as more components are added to the ship
- make player movement less bad (Max linear and rotational speed, quicker acceleration, etc)
- make a stats script on the player that calculates the mass, strength of linear and rotational
  acceleration, HP, stuff like that.
- hitting enemys at high speeds has GOTTA hurt bruh
